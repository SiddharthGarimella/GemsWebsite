      About Us
      <p>
        {" "}
        After having worked as a preschool teacher for 5 years at Challenger
        School, and for a few years at Stratford School, my love for kiddos and
        my passion for teaching motivated me to start my own child care. I want
        to create an environment that is nurturing, where kiddos are cared for
        with respect, treated with dignity keeping in mind their own unique
        characteristics.
      </p>

        {" "}
        In our competitive society it is important for students to not only
        receive a solid education but to work with someone who is aware and
        sensitive to their individual needs and capabilities. I believe that
        children are like young plants, different in their own ways but if
        nurtured well, they will all blossom to their full potential.

        {" "}
        Here at Gems Academy I provide a very fun filled; activity packed;
        learning environment which will not only instill in children a love for
        learning but also enhance their confidence and self-esteem as they
        develop their speaking, reading, writing, fine/gross motor and social
        skills.
